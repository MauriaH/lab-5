# Computer Vision in Remote Sensing

In this lab I will be discussing how remote sensing has been utilized as an essential tool to monitoring inundation in Louisianna. Louisianna has been experienceing inundation at alarming rates and is considered to be one of the fastest sinking places in the world. There are many efforts being made by geographers to monitor inundation in this region and find ways to mitigate this problem. Nasa has begun the Delta X program, a research effort to solve Louisianna's inundation issues and implement these methods to other places around the world experiencing major inundation. Scientists involved in the DeltaX campaign have used airborne data collection to monitor changes in the Mississippi River Delta and predict future changes in sediment and create ecological models of possible inundation (Delta X)

Below are developed imagery from Landsat showing the changes in land over time in Louisianna. The first image is from September of 2015 and the second image is from September 2021.
