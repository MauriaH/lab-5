# Computer Vision in Remote Sensing

In this lab I will be discussing how remote sensing has been utilized as an essential tool to monitoring inundation in Louisianna. Louisianna has been experienceing inundation at alarming rates and is considered to be one of the fastest sinking places in the world. There are many efforts being made by geographers to monitor inundation in this region and find ways to mitigate this problem. Nasa has begun the Delta X program, a research effort to solve Louisianna's inundation issues and implement these methods to other places around the world experiencing major inundation. Scientists involved in the DeltaX campaign use a combination of airborne data collection and field collection to monitor changes in the Mississippi River Delta and predict future changes in sediment and create ecological models of possible inundation (Simard). Collecting a large and varied sample of data has allowed Delta X to create well callibrated models that will visualizae change and analysis of the land and water of the study area.

Below are developed imagery from Landsat showing the changes in land over time in Louisianna. The first image is from September of 2015 and the second image is from September 2021. The comparison of these false color composite images highlights the loss of land in coastal regions around Louisianna. There is a stark difference in the composition of the land in the photo from 2021, shown by the abundance of water that was not previously present in 2015.

Twunmasi et al. utilize remote sensing to determine areas that are at high risk of flooding across Louisianna. One method they use is digital elavation model classification (DEM) to determine the areas of southeast Louisianna that are below sea level (Twumasi et al., 2020). Areas below sea level are classified in dark and light green. This analysis determined that about 1.6 million people in just the southeast region of Louisianna live in a region below sea level, as shown in the below image(Twumasi et al., 2020).

For locations prone to natural disaster, like Louisianna, remote sensing analysis can be used to model predictions of how future disaster will impact land. These predictions can then be used to inform policy makers on what they can do to save the lives of residents and prevent displacement.
